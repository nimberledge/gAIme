# BlackHoleAI

Here is an AI that plays Black Hole against the user. Black Hole is a logic game, played as follows:

1. Fill up the board with all your chips (10 for each player), in increasing number of points for every turn. There are 21 spaces and 20 chips (in total, counting both players), thus there will be an empty space at the end.

2. The last space in the board will be considered a black hole, and the player with the least points sucked in will be the winner. If the points sucked in for both players are equal, it's a tie.

Some points to note:
1. The first player will always play in red, and the second always in blue.
2. The computer may start the game, happens about once in 4 games.
3. The result of the game is displayed on the console after the pygame window quits.
4. DO NOT click the screen before the AI has played. You WILL cause the game to bug out, and I don't care about that.

How to play:
1. Download the folder in full
2. Extract its contents into another folder, (eg. MyFolder1)
3. Make sure BlackHoleFiles is a sub-folder in whichever directory (eg. MyFolder1) you extract into.
4. Run playblackhole.py

Disclaimer: The GUI is definitely not the greatest piece of work I have produced, however I only created it to test the AI. If you try to bend the rules of the game, IT WILL RAISE BUGS, and that will not concern me. 

Finally,
Good luck, and have fun!
