gAIme - Generalized board game AI

The inspiration behind this project was learning traditional AI algorithms for board games - e.g. minimax, monte carlo, noting that they weren't very game-specific, and then implementing them in abstract. With the current implementation, one can write very little code - just about enough to define a game-state for the given board game and have a state.next_move() function that applies one of the traditional algorithms to pick a good move.

This started as an individual project, turned into a team effort once I reached university, and now is back to its original state as an individual effort.
